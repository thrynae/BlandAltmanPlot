This function creates a Bland-Altman plot and returns a struct with results and handles.

This function does not require any toolbox (thanks to some functions by [Star Strider](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/99682)). The second advantage of this function is that it returns all the handles in a struct so it is easy to modify any object (changing the text sizes, or changing the plot type).
